Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Overview
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Machine Learning (ML):
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms
and statistical models that allow computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed.
ML algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.

Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning: Model learns from labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).
- Unsupervised Learning: Model identifies patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Reinforcement Learning: Model learns by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards.

Applications of ML:
- Spam detection in emails
- Predictive maintenance in manufacturing
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Stock price prediction

2. Deep Learning (DL):
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks)
to model complex patterns in data. It is particularly effective for unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.

Key Concepts:
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Layers of nodes (neurons) that process input data to produce output.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Specialized for image processing.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) & LSTMs: Specialized for sequential data like text and time series.
- Transformers: Modern architectures for NLP tasks (e.g., GPT, BERT).

Applications of DL:
- Image recognition (e.g., self-driving cars)
- Natural language processing (e.g., chatbots, translation)
- Speech recognition
- Generative AI (e.g., image and text generation)

Summary:
ML is great for structured data and traditional predictive tasks, whereas DL excels at learning complex patterns
from large amounts of unstructured data. Both fields are essential for modern AI applications.
